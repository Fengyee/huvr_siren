## TL;DR

SASNet pairs a **frozen frequency embedding layer** with a lightweight hash-grid MLP that produces **spatially-adaptive masks**. The masks select, per location and per frequency band, which sinusoidal neurons contribute to the output. This suppresses high-frequency leakage in smooth regions while preserving fine detail around edges and surfaces, yielding higher accuracy and faster convergence on image fitting, volumetric reconstruction, and SDF tasks at only modest overhead from the mask generation network.

## Install

```bash
conda create -n sasnet python=3.10
conda activate sasnet
pip install -e .
```

The hash-grid mask generator is required whenever you construct `SASNet(use_masks=True)` (the full SASNet model used in all paper experiments). It is built on [kaolin-wisp](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/kaolin-wisp); install it from its upstream repository before enabling masks. The unmasked SIREN-style baseline (`SASNet(use_masks=False)`) runs without kaolin-wisp.
